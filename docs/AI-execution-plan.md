## Phased Development Strategy for AI Development Teams

---

## Project Overview & Setup

**Project**: Kiwi Theme WordPress FSE Theme  
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) with MCP Tool Integration  
**Target**: WordPress.org Directory Submission  
**Timeline**: 5 Phases, 15-20 Steps  

### AI Development Guidelines
- **Use MCP Tools Extensively**: Leverage GitHub, Puppeteer, Playwright, file system access throughout development
- **Iterate and Test Continuously**: Run automated tests after each significant change
- **Validate in Real-Time**: Use browser automation to verify visual and functional changes
- **Commit Frequently**: Make granular commits with clear messages for easy tracking

### Repository Setup Requirements
- **Branch Strategy**: `main` → `develop` → feature branches
- **Commit Convention**: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, test:, docs:, style:, refactor:)
- **PR Strategy**: Each phase = 1 PR to `develop`, final PR to `main`
- **Testing**: All tests must pass before PR approval

### Available MCP Tools
- **GitHub**: Repository management, branch creation, PR creation
- **Puppeteer**: Browser automation for testing and validation
- **Playwright**: Cross-browser testing and screenshot comparison
- **File System**: Direct file manipulation and code generation
- **Web Navigation**: Testing live sites and external validation

## Phase 5: WordPress.org Compliance & Final Testing
**Objective**: Ensure complete WordPress.org directory compliance and prepare for submission

### Step 5.1: WordPress Coding Standards & Security
**Objective**: Ensure all code meets WordPress standards and security requirements

**MCP Tools to Use**: Code analysis tools, security scanning, WordPress standards validation
**Iterative Testing**: Run coding standards and security checks after each code change

**Deliverables**:
- WordPress Coding Standards compliance
- Security best practices implementation
- Input sanitization and output escaping
- Nonce verification where needed
- SQL injection prevention

**Watch Out For**:
- Escaping functions breaking legitimate HTML
- Nonce verification interfering with caching
- Security measures affecting theme performance
- Coding standards conflicts with FSE requirements
- Over-sanitization breaking functionality

**Completion Criteria**:
- WordPress Coding Standards checker passes (automated PHPCS validation)
- All user inputs are properly sanitized (automated security scanning)
- All outputs are properly escaped (code analysis validation)
- No security vulnerabilities detected (automated security testing)
- Theme passes WordPress Security scan (security tool integration)

**AI Testing Instructions**:
- Run automated WordPress Coding Standards checks using PHPCS
- Use security scanning tools to validate input sanitization
- Automate output escaping validation with code analysis
- Test for common security vulnerabilities with automated tools
- Validate nonce implementation with security testing

**Git Instructions**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/wordpress-compliance
git commit -m "fix: ensure WordPress Coding Standards compliance"
git commit -m "security: implement proper input sanitization"
git commit -m "security: add output escaping for all dynamic content"
git commit -m "security: implement nonce verification where needed"
```

### Step 5.2: Internationalization & Localization
**Objective**: Prepare theme for international users and translation

**MCP Tools to Use**: Translation validation tools, RTL testing, internationalization scanners
**Iterative Testing**: Validate translation functions and RTL support after each i18n implementation

**Deliverables**:
- All strings properly internationalized
- POT file generation
- RTL language support
- Date and number formatting
- Locale-specific styling adjustments

**Watch Out For**:
- Hardcoded strings remaining in templates
- Text domain inconsistencies
- RTL layout breaking design
- Date formatting causing layout issues
- Missing context for translators

**Completion Criteria**:
- All user-facing strings use translation functions (automated string scanning)
- POT file contains all translatable strings (POT file validation)
- RTL languages display correctly (automated RTL testing)
- No hardcoded text remains in theme files (hardcoded string detection)
- Translation functions use consistent text domain (text domain validation)

**AI Testing Instructions**:
- Use automated tools to scan for untranslated strings
- Generate and validate POT file completeness
- Test RTL layout using automated browser language switching
- Validate text domain consistency across all files
- Test date and number formatting with different locales

**Git Instructions**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/internationalization
git commit -m "i18n: internationalize all user-facing strings"
git commit -m "i18n: generate POT file for translations"
git commit -m "i18n: add RTL language support and styling"
git commit -m "i18n: implement locale-specific formatting"
```

### Step 5.3: Theme Unit Test Compatibility
**Objective**: Ensure theme handles all WordPress content scenarios properly

**MCP Tools to Use**: Automated content generation, WordPress importer, edge case testing
**Iterative Testing**: Test with various content scenarios and edge cases continuously

**Deliverables**:
- Theme Unit Test data compatibility
- Edge case content handling
- Graceful degradation implementation
- Error state management
- Content length variation handling

**Watch Out For**:
- Theme breaking with unusual content
- Long titles causing layout issues
- Missing featured images breaking design
- Special characters causing encoding issues
- Empty content states not handled gracefully

**Completion Criteria**:
- All Theme Unit Test content displays correctly (automated unit test validation)
- Long and short content both handled well (content length testing)
- Missing content scenarios handled gracefully (error state testing)
- Special characters display properly (character encoding validation)
- No fatal errors with any content type (error monitoring)

**AI Testing Instructions**:
- Automate Theme Unit Test data import and validation
- Generate content with extreme variations (very long/short, special characters)
- Test missing content scenarios (no featured images, empty posts)
- Validate special character handling with automated encoding tests
- Monitor for fatal errors during content variation testing

**Git Instructions**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/unit-test-compatibility
git commit -m "test: ensure compatibility with Theme Unit Test data"
git commit -m "fix: handle edge cases for content length variations"
git commit -m "fix: implement graceful degradation for missing content"
git commit -m "fix: resolve special character encoding issues"
```

### Step 5.4: Final Validation & Documentation
**Objective**: Complete final validation and prepare submission documentation

**MCP Tools to Use**: WordPress Theme Check automation, documentation validation, package creation
**Iterative Testing**: Validate all documentation and run final compliance checks

**Deliverables**:
- Theme Check plugin validation
- Comprehensive README documentation
- Installation instructions
- Customization guide
- Changelog preparation

**Watch Out For**:
- Theme Check plugin false positives
- Documentation becoming outdated
- Installation instructions missing steps
- Customization guide being too technical
- Changelog missing important changes

**Completion Criteria**:
- Theme Check plugin passes with no issues (automated Theme Check validation)
- Documentation is complete and user-friendly (documentation validation)
- Installation process is clearly explained (installation testing)
- Customization options are well documented (customization validation)
- Changelog accurately reflects all changes (changelog validation)

**AI Testing Instructions**:
- Automate Theme Check plugin execution and validation
- Validate documentation completeness and accuracy
- Test installation instructions on fresh WordPress installations
- Validate customization guide with automated customizer testing
- Generate comprehensive changelog from commit history

**Git Instructions**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/final-validation
git commit -m "docs: complete README with installation and customization guides"
git commit -m "docs: prepare comprehensive changelog"
git commit -m "fix: resolve all Theme Check plugin issues"
git commit -m "docs: finalize documentation for WordPress.org submission"
```

## Project Overview

Kiwi Theme is a modern WordPress Full Site Editing (FSE) theme designed for flexible content publishing with multiple content types. It features a fixed sidebar navigation, RSS-first content strategy, and adaptive publishing workflows. The theme emphasizes clean design and technical excellence while supporting diverse content formats.

**Core Philosophy**: Modern, flexible theme architecture supporting varied content publishing needs

## Development Workflow Memory

- At the end of each part (eg. 1.1, 1.2 etc) return and test, check, and reiterate before creating granular, thoughtful commits then moving to the next section.
- At the end of each phase, always run tests, lint, and create a well written PR with a manual testing checklist.
